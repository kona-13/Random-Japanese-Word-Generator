# Random-Japanese-Word-Generator
Generates 30 random Japanese words from a list - intended for use with the Goldlist method for learning vocab

The words were pulled from this list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PjfuQSsbkixNGj_9U271M6eqGVVWp5ATRivKlN06S4/edit#gid=0

So far it is just the "JLPT4" words - with plans to add more to and improve it (a lot lol).

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.
